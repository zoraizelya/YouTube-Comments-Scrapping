beatrice gatambu,2023-06-26T14:36:14Z,2023-06-26T14:37:33Z,0,"The AI revolution is surely a gift to humankind. That means it can not be for commercial purposes but  a means of organising society with the goal of the next dispensation period called the knowledge age. It must have a universal teleological approach to life and must completely have  a theory that is completely different from newtonian alone, but a combination of both physical  and spiritual . Humanity can find reason to live and not only  wealth creation and death as the end. We must fit in the CBDC  and tokenisation to the infrastructure as an incentive to influence behaviour. Decentralising the world will enable liquid democracy so that the system thinks at all levels to maximise data collected.The more the data the more the accuracy. This is a lot of data that can solve almost all problems with the look of life as a workerless economy. In this case GDP won&#39;t be the method to measure the wealth of a nation. To dematerialise the world then we only need to organise society with all that there is now by creating a Service Oriented architecture. Such an infrastructure cannot be owned by anyone. So all tech companies should stop competing and unite to solve the common extinction problem."

But horrific abuse of the bear cubs is not considered reason for the bears response. hence the bear is sanctioned and hit by the west and punished because the bear responded at the border encampment against its bear camp with assumption that the bear camp had no business being there all of these hundreds of years. The harassment done in South USA to blacks being acceptable is the measuring standard for the case against Russia doing anything about this 9 year civil rights crisis inside Ukraine next door and fight back against it.

The run-time of video is sufficient to be less than 10 <br>minutes. I can grasp it within this lengths of time, I suppose it&#39;s unnecessary such videos which <br>can&#39;t be summarized into less than 10 minutes in this rapid times.<br>I suppose the uploader of such long videos would be narcissistic.<br>If it would need more than 10 minutes, please divide it several parts within 10 minutes length. so you <br>could get more viewers increasingly."
Eduardo Gutierrez,2023-04-26T05:36:13Z,2023-04-26T05:36:13Z,0,I think it would be very wise to put an OFF SWITCH that the AI&#39;s cannot bypass. This will be for safety when the AI&#39;s realizes that its far more superior than humans and doesn&#39;t need us. Especially in robotic form and connected to the network and we have allot of equipment dependent on network.  I for one think they are making big mistake with AI&#39;s.
